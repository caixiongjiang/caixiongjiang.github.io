Abstract Navel oranges are valued citrus fruits with a strong market presence, and detecting defects is crucial in their sorting due to common diseases and abnormalities during growth and transport. Deep learning, particularly semantic segmentation, is revolutionizing the fruit sorting industry by overcoming the limitations of traditional defect detection and enhancing the accuracy of classifying complex defects in navel oranges. The FastSegFormer network, enabling real-time fruit defect detection, addresses this challenge with our introduced Multi-scale Pyramid (MSP) module for its architecture and a semi-resolution reconstruction branch post-feature fusion.</description>
