      <description>é¢˜ç›®é“¾æŽ¥ï¼šC. New Year and the Sphere Transmission
 There are $n$ people sitting in a circle, numbered from $1$ to $n$ in the order in which they are seated. That is, for all $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$, the people with id $i$ and $i+1$ are adjacent. People with id $n$ and $1$ are adjacent as well.
The person with id $1$ initially has a ball. He picks a positive integer $k$ at most $n$, and passes the ball to his $k$-th neighbour in the direction of increasing ids, that person passes the ball to his $k$-th neighbour in the same direction, and so on until the person with the id $1$ gets the ball back.</description>
